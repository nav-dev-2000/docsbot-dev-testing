## Overview

[HelpScout](https://helpscout.grsm.io/9cush642f1y3) is a popular support software used by many businesses to provide a support widget in their website. But with DocsBot you can first display our widget to privide an AI frontline support agent that can answer the most common questions about your product or service in any language! If the user still needs help, they can click the support link in the widget to open your HelpScout Beacon widget to talk to a human.

## HelpScout Beacon Integration

If your business uses [HelpScout](https://helpscout.grsm.io/9cush642f1y3) Beacon for support tickets or live chat, here's an example of how you could use the `supportCallback` argument to open the Helpscout Beacon widget if the user clicks the get support link in the DocsBot Widget.

Your existing Beacon embed code may look something like this:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">!function(e,t,n){function a(){var e=t.getElementsByTagName("script")...</script>
<script type="text/javascript">window.Beacon('init', 'YOUR_BEACON_ID_HERE')</script>
```

To keep your Beacon from showing by default, remove the init script from the embed code. It looks like this:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">window.Beacon('init', 'YOUR_BEACON_ID_HERE')</script>
```

Then you'll need to add the DocsBot widget embed code to your website. You can find the embed code by clicking the "Widget Embed" link on your bot. You can find more information about the widget embed code [here](/docs/embeddable-chat-widget).

Finally adjust the DocsBoc initialization code to open the HelpScout Beacon widget when the user clicks the support link in the DocsBot widget:

```js
DocsBotAI.init({
    id: "YOUR_ID_HERE",
    supportCallback: function (event, history) {
        event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default behavior opening the url.
        DocsBotAI.unmount(); // Hide the widget.
        // Open the Helpscout Beacon widget.
        Beacon('init', 'YOUR_BEACON_ID_HERE'); // Replace with your beacon id, assuming you havn't already initialized the beacon.
        Beacon('open');
    },
})
```

{% callout type="warning" title="Make sure to add a support url!" %}
For any of these integrations to work you must add a support url to your bot settings so that it will show the support link in the widget. If you don't want to use the support link, you can simply add a `#` to the url field.
{% /callout %}

That's it! Now when the user clicks the support link in the DocsBot widget, the HelpScout Beacon widget will open so they can start a live chat or ticket with a human support agent.
