As an <strong>exclusive feature of your ${report.plan} subscription</strong> for ${report.name} with DocsBot AI, this report aims to provide actionable insights to optimize your user experience and fine-tune your documentation.</p>
  
  <h2>Why are these reports important?</h2>

  <p>By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, we analyze every question asked by your users, using topic clustering to group similar questions together and identify the main themes and their sub-topics. The goal is to categorize the most common queries, providing invaluable information for making data-driven decisions to better meet your users' needs and improve your bots.</p>

  <h2>What's included in these reports?</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>All Questions:</strong> We generate a report from all user questions by default. This report is useful for identifying the most common questions asked by users and improving the user experience for these parts of your product or business.</li>
  <li><strong>Problem Questions:</strong> If there is enough data we also create a report variation highlighting poorly rated questions or ones that led to a support escalation. This can help you identify gaps in your documentation and improve your bot's ability to answer questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Reports are generated only for bots that have at least 100 user queries during the specified month and are generated on the 1st of the subsequent month.</em></p>

  <h2>How to access your reports</h2>
  
  <p>You can easily access your reports by clicking the "Reports" button <a href="https://docsbot.ai/app/bots">in the dashboard</a> for any of your bots, or you may use any of the direct links below:</p>
  <ul>`

  for (const bot of report.reports) {
    emailBody += `<li><a href="https://docsbot.ai/app/bots/${bot.botId}/reports">${bot.name}</a></li>`
  }

  emailBody += `</ul>
  <p>We appreciate your continued partnership as a ${report.plan} subscriber. If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to contact us at human@docsbot.ai for prompt assistance from our support team.</p>
